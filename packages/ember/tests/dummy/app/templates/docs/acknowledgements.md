## Development

This library was incubated within one particular project at [Salsify](https://www.salsify.com/). It underwent several iterations in that time, and [@mnoble01](https://github.com/mnoble01) and [@deverstalmage](https://github.com/deverstalmage) were exceedingly tolerant of the proliferation of ill-behaved early versions of milestones (f.k.a. "sync points") in their test suite. They gamely helped debug when things went wrong, and offered invaluable input brainstorming what an ideal API for solving these asynchrony problems might even look like.
